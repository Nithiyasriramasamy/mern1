        <h3>Sundar Pichai</h3>
        <p>CEO of Google and Alphabet</p>
        <p>
            Sundar Pichai is an Indian-American business executive who joined Google in 2004 and
            became the CEO in 2015. He is known for leading Chrome, Android, and several Google innovations.
         </p>
        <p>
            He is also the CEO of Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sundar Pichai's recent tweets include a November 28th Thanksgiving message where he shared an infographic created with "Nano Banana Pro" to visualize holiday search trends, and a November 20th post about the "Geminiii" release of Google's Gemini 3 AI model. He also recently shared an update about "Nano Banana Pro," a new, more advanced version of the AI tool. 
        </p>
        <p>Geminiii tweet: Following the release of Google's Gemini 3 AI model, Pichai tweeted "Geminiii" on November 20, 2025. The extra "i" was a subtle reference to the model's version number, and the post received a congratulatory response from Elon Musk.</p>
        <p>
            Nano Banana Pro update: Pichai shared an update about "Nano Banana Pro" on November 28, 2025, revealing that it is a more advanced version of the AI tool.

            Performance: The Quantum Echoes algorithm running on the Willow chip performed a complex calculation 13,000 times faster than the best classical algorithm on one of the world's fastest supercomputers. This built on a previous achievement where a quantum computer solved a problem in under five minutes that would have taken a supercomputer 10 septillion years.
        </P>
        <P>
            Implications: This milestone demonstrates the potential of quantum computing to solve problems that are currently intractable for classical computers. It opens up new possibilities for advancements in fields such as cryptography, materials science, and complex system simulations.
        </P>
